# Greenhouse monitoring/control stuff

This is what is hooked up around my aquaponics system.

Did not have time to paste in temperature/humidity sensor code before leaving on vacation, but with help of [a friend](https://github.com/hjon) was able to get this much working to feed the fish remotely.

TBD: make web-accessible via [microstates](https://github.com/natevw/microstates), etc.
